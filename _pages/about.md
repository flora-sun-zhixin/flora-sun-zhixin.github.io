My name is Zhixin Sun and most of the time I go by "Flora". I am a 1st year Ph.D. student starting from 2022 Fall in the Imaging Science program at Washington University in St. Louis. Before this, I received a bachelor's degree in Econimics Statistics from Southwestern University in Finance and Economics in China. Then, I received a M.S. degree in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis. Now I am working in Computational Imaging Group, co-supervised by Professor Monica Shokeen and Professor Ulugbek Kamilov.  

Currently my research focusing on setting up a pipeline that can evaluate the course of Multiple Myeloma basing on Micro PET/CT. The aim is to offer an efficient and consistent evaluation tool for preclinical study that is free from the bias introduced by human labeling.  

My research interest include segmentation, registration, inverse problem, optimization and this is not a complete list yet.

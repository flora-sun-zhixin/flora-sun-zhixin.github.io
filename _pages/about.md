My name is Zhixin Sun and most of the time I go by "Flora". I am a 1st year Ph.D. student, starting from 2022 Fall in the [Imaging Science program](https://engineering.wustl.edu/academics/programs/imaging-science/index.html) at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). Before this, I received a bachelor's degree in Econimics Statistics from Southwestern University in Finance and Economics in China. Then, I received a M.S. degree in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis. Now I am working in [Computational Imaging Group(CIG)](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/), co-supervised by [Professor Monica Shokeen](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/employees/monica-shokeen/) and [Professor Ulugbek Kamilov](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/ulugbek-s-kamilov/).  

Currently my research is focusing on setting up a pipeline that can evaluate the course of Multiple Myeloma basing on Micro PET/CT. The goal is to offer an efficient and consistent evaluation tool for preclinical study that is free from the bias introduced by human labeling.  

For now, my research interests lie in segmentation, registration, inverse problem, and optimization. However, this is not a complete list yet.
